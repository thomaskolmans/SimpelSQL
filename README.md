# SimpleSQL
_A php library that makes SQL simpel._ Build your applications much faster with *simple* and fast communication to your database. 

# Why?
SimpleSQL is a very lightweight library that will speed up your proccess of creating, selecting, updating and all your other SQL queries. It's a very easy syntax and has also multiple ways of doing your queries, there is a basic set of SQL functions that will work with the documented parameters, but then you can also *build* your own query through our building structure. 

# Installation
We recommend using `composor` to install our library. Look at how to install composor [here](https://getcomposer.org/)

```
You can also download the library and install it manually. Download button will be added when the first official release is there.
